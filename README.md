Scripts to scan options for arbitrage trades


Original script is taken from pmtraders discord.
Sadly this uses TD Ameritrade's API and can't be used without a TDA account.
For europoors we need to convert this script to Interactive brokers.
I started with this task and currently the script is able to fetch the option chain from IB, next step is to implement the logic for comparing prices.
